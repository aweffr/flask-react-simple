Version 0.1.5
-------------
After so many trails, I think that separating the frontend and backend is such a good thing.
Also, facebook's create-react-app is so excellent that my re-invention cannot compete.

So, the change is to embrace the create-react-app, just add some of my flavor of conventions.


Version 0.1.2
-------------
Add class FlaskReact, functionality still need implement.


Version 0.1.1
-------------
Improve the cli command.


Version 0.1.0
-------------
Init Project.
